Code for the lazy generation of canonical programs.
*Paper to be published.*

Relation to paper
=================

Towards the bottom of ProgGen.lhs one should find a case switch
for selecting various test packages. These relate to the benchmarks
detailed in the paper.

Things I would like to still do
===============================

- [ ] Show that all programs have a mapping to a canonical representative.
- [ ] Random selection from equivalence classes of canonical forms.
